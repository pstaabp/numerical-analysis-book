    <p>
      Recall that a polynomial is a function of the form:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      where <m>a_{k}</m> are constants and <m>a_{n} \neq 0</m> is called the <alert>leading coefficient</alert>.
      The <alert>degree</alert> of the polynomial is <m>n</m>.
      Polynomials are quite important in numerical analysis.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Examples of polynomials include <m>5, 3x-1, 3x^{2}+ 9x^{4}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Functions that are not polynomials: <m>\sqrt{x},\frac{x-1}{3x^{2}+1}, \sin x, e^{x}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      The polynomials with small degrees are generally called more specific names.
      Here are the polynomials of degrees with 0, 1, 2 and 3.

    <title>Power Functions</title>

    <p>
      A power function has form <m>f(x) = x^{n}</m> for <m>n</m> a nonnegative integer.
      These functions are the building blocks of polynomials.
      The graph of <m>f(x) = x^{n}</m> for <m>n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6</m>:

    <title>Forms of Polynomials</title>

    <p>
      <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Standard Form</title>

        <p>
          <men xml:id="eq-std-form">
            p(x) = a_{0} + a_{1} x + a_{2} x^{2} + \cdots + a_{n} x^{n}
          </men>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a simple compact form of a polynomial and this can be useful for various types of theorems and it easy to see the degree and leading coefficient of the polynomial.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Factored Form:</title>

        <p>
          The factored form of a polynomial can be written:
        </p>

        <p>
          <men xml:id="eq-poly-factored-form">
            p(x) = a(x-x_0)^{k_0} (x-x_1)^{k_1} \cdots (x-x_m)^{k_m}
          </men>
        </p>

        <p>
          where the roots are <m>x_{0},x_{1},x_{m}</m> and have <alert>multiplicity</alert> <m>k_{0}, k_{1}, \ldots k_{m}</m> respectively with <m>a=a_{n}</m> from the standard form above, called the <alert>leading coefficient</alert> and the multiplicities satisfy: <m>n = k_{0}+k_{1} + \cdots + k_{m}</m>, where <m>n</m> is the degree.
          Not all polynomials in standard form can be written in factored form, which assumes that all roots are real.
        </p>

        <p>
          The factored form obviously gives you the roots directly, however, one can easily create a graph from this form as well.
          The behavior as <m>|x| \rightarrow \infty</m>, is the same as the power function with leading coefficient.
          That is it behaves like <m>a_{n} x^{n}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, the graph near each zero behaves like the multiplicity of zero.
          An example is given below in ???
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Horner's Form</title>

        <p>
          Lastly, if a polynomial is written in a nested form like
        </p>

        <p>
          <men xml:id="eq-poly-horner-form">
            p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x (a_2 + x(a_3+ \cdots)))
          </men>
        </p>

        <p>
          it is in <alert>Horner’s Form</alert>, which is generally an efficient way of evaluating the polynomial at a point, both in terms of efficiency of operations and in terms of rounding errors as will be seen in ????

  <subsection>
    <title>Graphs of Polynomials</title>

    <p>
      The graph of a polynomial is most easily understood in factored form (eq:poly:factored:form).
      The following can be determined directly from this form:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <m>x</m>-intercepts are the roots of the polynomial, <m>x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The shape of the polynomial near <m>x=x_{i}</m> is <m>b_{i}(x-x_{i})^{k_i}</m>, where <m>b_{i}=\lim_{x \rightarrow x_i}p(x)/(x-x_{i})^{k_i}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The end behavior of the graph (shape of the curve for <m>|x| \rightarrow \infty</m>) is similar to the power function <m>ax^{n}</m>, where <m>n</m> is the degree and <m>a</m> is the leading coefficient.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The intervals of positive and negative values of the polynomial can be found by first understanding the sign of the power function <m>ax^{n}</m> for <m>x>0</m> and <m>x&#x3C;0</m>, which depends on the sign of <m>a</m> and if <m>n</m> is even or odd.
            Once the sign of <m>p</m> is known for large <m>x</m> (in the positive or negative direction), we know that <m>p</m> will only switch sign over a zero with odd multiplicity.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following few examples shows how to both manipulate polynomials as well as pull out the important information.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the polynomial <m>f(x) = 3x(x+1)(x-2)^{2}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                List all real zeros of the polynomial and the multiplicity of each.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the <m>x</m>-intercepts and if the cross or just touch at each.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Find the power function that the polynomial resembles for large <m>|x|</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Find intervals where the graph is above or below the <m>x</m>-axis.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the graph of <m>f</m> near each zero.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                With all given information, plot <m>y=f(x)</m> with the graphs in #5.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The zeros are <m>x=0</m> (mult.
                1), <m>x=-1</m> (mult.
                1) and <m>x=2</m> mult.
                2
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The <m>x</m>-intercepts cross at <m>x=0,-1</m> and just touch <m>x=2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The power function is <m>y=3x^{4}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Since the power function for large <m>|x|</m> is <m>3x^{4}</m>, left of <m>-1</m> and right of <m>2</m> the function is positive.
                Recalling that the polynomial changes sign over roots of odd multiplicity however doesn’t over even multiplicity, one gets the following sign chart:

      The next example shows use of these same concepts to construct the graph.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Construct the graph of the polynomial:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            p(x)= -\frac{1}{5}(x-2)^{3}(x+1)^{2}(x+3) \\
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          This polynomial is in factored form.
          The roots are <m>2, -1</m> and <m>-3</m> with multiplicities 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
          Also, the degree of the polynomial is the sum of the multiplicities or 6.
          Notice that the term in front is <m>-1/5</m>, so the leading term is <m>-\frac{1}{5}x^{6}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The intervals on which the polynomial is positive and negative is found the following way.
          Note that the leading term is <m>-\frac{1}{5}x^{6}</m>, the far behavior of <m>p</m> is the same as this so it is negative for <m>|x| \rightarrow \infty</m>.
          The polynomial will change sign over the roots of odd multiplicity or at <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-3</m>.
          Therefore the sign of the polynomial can be summarized in the following sign chart:

      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the standard form and Horner form of the polynomial <m>p(x)=-\frac{1}{5}(x-2)^{3}(x+1)^{2}(x+3)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          The standard form is found by expanding all of the terms.
          This is a little painful, so a CAS like Matlab, Maple or Mathematica is often helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            p(x) = -\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{6}+\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{5}+{\frac{11\,{x}^{4}}{5}}-{\frac{13\,{x}^{3 }}{5}}-{\frac{26\,{x}^{2}}{5}}+4\,x+{\frac{24}{5}}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the Horner form, we successive factor out an <m>x</m> in a nested way:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            \begin{aligned} p(x)\amp= \biggl(-\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{5}+\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{4}+{\frac{11\,{x}^{3}}{5}}-{\frac{13\,{x}^{2 }}{5}}-{\frac{26\,{x}}{5}}+4\biggr)x+{\frac{24}{5}}\\\amp= \biggl(\biggl(-\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{4}+\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{3}+{\frac{11\,{x}^{2}}{5}}-{\frac{13\,{x}}{5}}-\frac{26}{5}\biggr)x+4\biggr)x+{\frac{24}{5}}\\\amp= \biggl(\biggl(\biggl(-\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{3}+\frac{1}{5}\,{x}^{2}+{\frac{11\,x}{5}}-{\frac{13}{5}}\biggr) x-\frac{26}{5}\biggr)x+4\biggr)x+{\frac{24}{5}}\\\amp= \vdots \\\amp= \biggl(\biggl(\biggl(\biggl(\biggl(-\frac{1}{5}x+\frac{1}{5}\biggr)x+{\frac{11}{5}}\biggr)x-{\frac{13}{5}}\biggr) x-\frac{26}{5}\biggr)x+4\biggr)x+{\frac{24}{5}}\\ \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          As we will see later in ?????, the Horner form also decreases round off errors and shorten the number of operations needed to evaluate the polynomial.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Also as we will see in section sect:optimal:pts, some polynomials have properties that seem to be nice may not be so nice.
      For example a polynomial with equally spaced roots have a nice form, but the local extrema get very large.
      The following example is a polynomial with equally-spaced roots.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <alert>Wilkinson polynomial</alert> is a polynomial of some degree <m>n</m> (an integer) with the following property: the polynomial as roots at <m>1,2,3, \ldots, n</m>, each of which has multiplicity 1.
          Write down the Wilkinson polynomial of degree 5.
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> with the following roots and multiplicity:
        </p>

        <tabular>
          <row>
            <cell>Roots</cell>
            <cell>1</cell>
            <cell>-1</cell>
            <cell>2</cell>
          </row>

          <row>
            <cell>Multiplicity</cell>
            <cell>2</cell>
            <cell>1</cell>
            <cell>3</cell>
          </row>
        </tabular>

        <p>
          and satisfies <m>f(3)=-4</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          First, we write a general polynomial that satisfies the roots property with appropriate multiplicity:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            f(x) = A(x-1)^{2}(x+1)(x-2)^{3}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          and then find <m>A</m> using <m>f(3)=-4</m>,
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            -4 = A(3-1)^{2}(3+1)(3-2)^{3} = 16A
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          so <m>A=-1/4</m> and the polynomial is:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            f(x) = -\frac{1}{4}(x-1)^{2}(x+1)(x-2)^{3}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      In Section ????, we will cover how to find a polynomial that passes through a given set of points.
      The next example is a fundamental building block of such polynomials called a Lagrange polynomial.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the simplest polynomial <m>p(x)</m> that has the property that <m>p(x_{0})=1</m>, <m>p(x_{1})=0</m> and <m>p(x_{2})=0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          Since there are 3 points that it must satisfy, unless there is a special relationship between <m>x_{0}, x_{1}</m> and <m>x_{2}</m>, we will probably need a quadratic.
          We know two of the zeros of the polynomial, so a form is:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            p(x) = A (x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          and then we use the third point to find <m>A</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            p(x_{0}) = 1 = A(x_{0}-x_{1})(x_{0}-x_{1})
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          or
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            A = \frac{1}{(x_{0}-x_{1})(x_{0}-x_{1})}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          therefore the polynomial is:
        </p>

        <p>
          <me>
            p(x) = \frac{(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})}{(x_{0}-x_{1})(x_{0}-x_{1})}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
